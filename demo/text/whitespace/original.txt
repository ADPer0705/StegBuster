 Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data or a physical object to avoid detection. Steganography can be used in combination with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. The word steganography comes from Greek and literally means "covered writing."  Unlike cryptography, which focuses on making data unreadable without a specific key, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that secret data exists at all. A message being transmitted may use steganography to disguise its presence in a cover object, such as a digital image file, an audio recording, or a text document. Digital steganography often involves using sophisticated algorithms to embed data into carrier files. Common techniques include:  1. Least Significant Bit insertion, where data is hidden in the least significant bits of digital files 2. Echo hiding in audio files, where secret messages are incorporated as echo 3. White space manipulation in text documents, where spaces and tabs encode binary data 4. Invisible characters in text, where zero-width characters hide information 5. Metadata manipulation, where file headers and metadata fields store hidden content  Detection of steganography is an active field in computer security known as steganalysis. It involves techniques ranging from statistical analysis to machine learning to identify when a file might contain hidden information. Modern applications of steganography range from digital watermarking for copyright protection to secure communication between parties who wish to avoid drawing attention to their correspondence. As both steganographic and steganalysis techniques evolve, the field remains an important area of study in information security.
